MeloHue is an interactive personal website. It combines retro design aesthetics inspired by the early Windows XP era with smooth, modern web interactions to create a distinctive digital space. The design is intentionally nostalgic appealing to users who value simplicity, aesthetics, and productivity.

This web app allows users to:

1. View their favorite vlog channels and music in one distraction-free space.

2. Enter a Focus Mode, with a random "Study With Me" YouTube video fetched through API.

3. Use the Spotify API to browse and personalize their music taste.

4. Maintain a personal music notebook, storing and revisiting songs they emotionally connect with.

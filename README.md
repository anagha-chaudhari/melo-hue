Hey :)
Welcome to MeloHue 🧸 just a quiet little space I made on the internet.

When I was younger, I’d often find comfort in study vlogs, especially one particular channel that has this real, mindful vibe. The kind of atmosphere that makes everything feel a little lighter, a little slower, a little hustle and little productive too in the best way.

I wanted a place where I could hold on to that feeling without all the usual distractions. Somewhere to watch their videos, listen to the music they used, and just… focus. Or relax. Or maybe both.

I don't consider this as big project — but just something made with care, for anyone who enjoys the same kind of quiet comfort.

Feel free to stay as long as you like.
I hope it brings you a little peace — or maybe even add a little meaning to your day. 🌿

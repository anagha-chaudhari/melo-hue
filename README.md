-- Description: --

MeloHue is an interactive personal website developed entirely from scratch. It combines retro design aesthetics inspired by the early Windows XP era with smooth, modern web interactions to create a distinctive digital space. The design is intentionally nostalgic appealing to users who value simplicity, aesthetics, and productivity.

This web app allows users to:

1. View their favorite vlog channels and music in one distraction-free space.

2. Enter a Focus Mode, with a random "Study With Me" YouTube video fetched through API.

3. Use the Spotify API to browse and personalize their music taste.

4. Maintain a personal music notebook, storing and revisiting songs they emotionally connect with.

All UI elements and structures were designed independently. Every feature and visual element was manually created.

-- APIs and External Use --

1. YouTube Data API: For fetching relevant background study videos and channel content.

2. Spotify API: To allow music search, playback preview, and playlist management.

3. Canva Free Icons: Only free-use icons were used under Canva’s free license policy.

4. Fonts are sourced from Google Fonts and are free for commercial and personal use under the Open Font License (OFL).

5. Images: index.png and favicon.png are AI-generated.
